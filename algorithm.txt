Step 1: Prep Connections
    - Request connection to database on CensusData.local
    - Ensure connection was successful

Step 2: Prep SVG file to be built
    - open\create virginia.svg
    - open the template file
    - insert header into virginia.svg
    - get a list of counties from the template file (so they are in order)

Step 3: The Main Loop
    - going through each line in the template file...
    - if the line number is even, insert the rgb path tag
    - if the line number is not even, write the line of the template to virginia.svg
