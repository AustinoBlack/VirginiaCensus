Step 1: Prep Connections
    - Request connection to database on CensusData.local
    - Ensure connection was successful

Step 2: Prep SVG file to be built
    - open\create virginia.svg
    - open the template file
    - insert header into virginia.svg
    - get a list of counties from the template file (so they are in order)

Step 3: The Main Loop
    - look at each line in the file
    - if a <title> line is found...
    - request to create an rgb tag for that county name
    - insert it into the svg
